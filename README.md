Task 4 - Implementation of Task 3 recipe program with promises and 

Here are the potential benefits and improvements of using the same listed:

Potential benefits of using Promises in this program include:

1. Simplified and more readable code: The code using Promises is more concise and easier to understand compared to the code using callbacks, since it avoids the "callback hell" that can arise from nested callbacks.
2. Better error handling: With Promises, you can use the catch method to handle errors and exceptions, making it easier to write robust and error-proof code.
3. Improved performance: Since Promises are non-blocking and asynchronous, they can make your code run faster, especially when you have multiple independent tasks that can be executed in parallel.


Improvements to this code could include:

1. Breaking down the displayRecipeStep function into smaller, reusable functions that can be used for other recipe steps.
2. Adding error handling to the displayRecipeStep function to catch exceptions and prevent the program from crashing.
3. Adding an additional catch block at the end of the displayRecipe function to handle any errors that may occur during the recipe steps.
4. Adding an additional check to make sure the recipe steps are valid and display an error message if not.
